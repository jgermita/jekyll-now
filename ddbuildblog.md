# Building Dust Devil 

## August 16

*123 blocks for scale*

Just printed off the first parts - the drive base and first set of drive wheels.

Thanks to the infill settings, I was able to go under the CAD projected weight. The drivebase sits at a nice 31.1 grams and the wheels are 5.6 grams each. Current weight as "assembled": 42.3g. 91% of my weight limit still available. .

I might have to print another set of wheels with the 3mm D more a little larger if I can't hack together a D broach to clean up this bore. 

Going to order hardware for dusty at some point next week. In the mean time, I'll be tweaking the module CAD models so I can send those out to waterjet with the other robot parts.
