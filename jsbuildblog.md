Drive escs arrived! Enertion FOCboxes for brushless drive. 

I'm being informed that these may be overkill. #yolo

Still trying to decide if I want to outsource waterjetting the jetstream frame or make it on the Gryffingear cnc router. Leaning towards router at the moment after figuring out how to automatically do dogbone fillets for material clearance. I think I'll test the concept when I cut the Dust Devil parts this weekend.
