I've been building combat robots as (another) (very expensive) hobby since 2016. Some of them came out alright.

**Record:** 0-0

**Weight Class:** 12lb

**Actual Weight:** 11.8lb

**Built:** Summer 2017

Second attempt with an emphasis on more efficient packaging and cleaner aesthetics. Featured #allbrushlesseverything and anodized parts throughout. Improved on Blackout's traction and weapon issues. Need to improve wedge mounting and geometry before Echo is ready for combat.

**Record:** 0-0

**Weight Class:** 12lb

**Actual Weight:** 14lb

**Built:** Fall 2016

This was my first attempt at a combat robot. It came in overweight, overbudget, and under capable. Plagued with weapon spinup and traction issues. Never fought. Currently serves as a punching bag bot.
