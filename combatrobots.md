I've been building combat robots as (another) (very expensive) hobby since 2016. Some of them came out alright. 

*About Level 5 Robotics:* The name Level 5 is a carryover of my very first introduction to robotics - my middle school's FIRST LEGO League team. The name retired as we aged out of the program, but I chose to recommission it as the name for my exploits in combat robotics. 

I take aesthetics and branding very seriously - sometimes too seriously... Aesthetically all robots feature a primarily black frame with an accent color for all of the fun bits. I feel this gives each robot a distinctive and memorable look among a sea of gray, white, and black robots. 

Thematically, I choose robot names that sound interesting or intimidating. My more recent robots have also been named after things found in the desert - where I build most of my robots.
