Fully custom MIDI controller project utilizing an Arduino UNO. Utilized a digital input multiplexer to monitor the state of 12 arcade buttons to generate MIDI commands to send to a computer over USB. 

### Genetic PID Tuner Platform - Summer 2015
Ideal PID gain tuning using genetic algorithms. Allowed user to specify input parameters and ideal conditions to find and simulate ideal PID gains over thousands of iterations. 

### Montecarlo FRC Match Simulator - Spring 2015
