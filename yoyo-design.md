Drawing for the base dimensions of a hubstack. Inner diameter may need adjustment depending on your production method. TODO: Find minimum height off of base.

### Fidget Stacks 

Silly hubstack design inspired by the great fidget spinner craze of 2017. Includes holes to insert M3x4 or 4-40x3/16" screws for added weight adjustment! Recommend Mcmaster-Carr #91290A109 for M3x4mm or #93465A103 for brass 4-40x3/16".
3D printable! Recommend printing with flat fidget spinner side down for printing without supports.
