I left my [first](http://www.jgermita.me/Sandstorm-Event-Report/) combat robot event super inspired to build more. Half of that was knowing that the more robots I build, the better I'll get at it. The other half was the burning desire to build more cool stuff.

Here are a couple of robot concepts I've been designing since then.

# Dust Devil - Antweight

Dust Devil originally started as a scaled down version of Sandstorm for the Antweight(1lb) weight class. While cleaning up the assembly, I realized that it would be trivial to make the weapon system modular. Dust Devil's 3 other modules were born soon after in a weekend CAD frenzy. 4-6 screws and a wiring harness hold each weapon in for quick module swaps. 

## Vertical

Uses the same Propdrive 2836 outrunner that I used on Sandstorm, but with a poor man's hub motor weapon setup for the shaft. Weapon disk is an assymetric single toothed drum. Planning on making this from AR500 steel.

## Horizontal

Same Propdrive motor as the vertical, but in a belt reduction setup driving a 3" aluminum bar with flat head screws as teeth. 

## Flipper

Features a choo-choo linkage spring loaded flipper like Tantrum and a couple of other robots by Aren. Linkage is driven by a 26rpm motor from Servo City. This is certainly the module that will see more IRL tinkering because of the linkage lengths. One detail I'm particularly proud of is figuring out how to use an actobotics hub as the choo choo hub rather than manufacturing it myself. 

## Wedge

Dust Devil W was the fastest to design. After watching some videos of Original Sin and other well driven wedges, I realized that rather than one continuous wedge, I could maximize floor contact by utilizing multiple independently pivoting wedgelets on a single shaft. This module is designed to be invertible so the wedgelets will work the same regardless of robot orientation. The snakehead-esque design of the mounting plate is to ensure that I can have positive pushing control over the target vs it just driving overthe top of Dust Devil.

# Mirage - Beetleweight

One of my biggest issues with Sandstorm was that it had far too much energy for its own good. Mirage takes the same exact weapon bar and orients it so that I can use the full kinetic energy of it for more of the match. 

# Jetstream - 12lb

Since there's a possibility of a 12lb event here in Socal, I wanted to take what I've learned at the smaller scale and apply it to a third attempt at a 12lb robot. This one should be an absolute tank with 1/4" plate joined with tab and slot joints throughout. Weapon geometry is still in the works, but this should be your run of the mill vertical drum spinner. The drive system will be absolute overkill featuring NTM propdrive 3542s driving versaplanetaries powered by two FOCBoxes.

# Other robot stuff

* I'll likely be redesigning Sandstorm's weapon to be an assymetric bar with a little bit less mass that I can throw at armor.
* Sandstorm, and by extension Mirage, will probably get the 22mm brushless mod
* Echo will either get a weapon system revamp or an overhaul into some sort of control bot. 
* Maybe I'll pick up work on the custom arduino controls mixer?
* The Sandstorm batteries have all been upgraded to XT30 connectors. Haven't done anything too intensive, but this seems to be a positive change over JST connectors.
